## Design

The unique design for this postcard consists of a green regular hexagon slightly overlapping a 6 by 6 grid that appears to be waving like a flag.

To the top right of the card, under the "THEY'RE COMING" text, there is a symbol that looks like an elongated asterisk.

The 6 digit number written on this card is **267,558**.

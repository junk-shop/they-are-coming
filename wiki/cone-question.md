## Design

The unique design for this postcard consists of a cone in what appears to be an isometric-front orientation, with part of the bottom face showing.

The vertex of the cone is encircled by two concentric circles.

To the right of the circles is the outline of a question mark.

The 6 digit number written on this card is **353,502**.

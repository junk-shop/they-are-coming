## Design

The unique design for this postcard consists of two circles overlapping in vertical-Venn-diagram fashion. The top circle is filled in green, while the bottom circle consists of six arcing lines to make it look like a globe.

To the right of the circles are one small oval, one larger oval, and an elongated asterisk symbol that is wider than both ovals.

The 6 digit number written on this card is **310,582**.

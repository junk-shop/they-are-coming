These cards appeared in peoples' mailboxes around the world, anywhere from one to four per box/household.

## Layout
Each card has a unique design, but certain layout characteristics are repeated across all six variations.

### "THEY'RE COMING" Text
At the top of each card, the phrase "THEY'RE COMING" is written in approximately the same size and vertical alignment. The font used seems to be a modified version of [Manufaktur](https://en.bestfonts.pro/font/manufaktur)

### Vertical Line & Number
There is a vertical line with arrowheads on both ends on each card, with a number running alongside it. This number appears to vary between the US and UK variants of the card. Spaces have been added to the following numbers for readability:
* US NUMBER: 1 575 291 7617
* UK NUMBER: 44 1722 638030

The US number can be traced to Roswell, New Mexico, while the UK number traces to Salisbury in England, near Stonehenge. In both instances, when called the number will play a [prerecorded audio](https://github.com/junk-shop/they-are-coming/wiki/phone-call-audio) before automatically ending the call.

### Six-Digit Number
There is a six-digit number located on each card that unique to each card design. The number is stylized with a comma, which can be used to interpret the number as an ordered pair. When all six numbers are plotted on a graph, a regular hexagon is formed.

### Glyph
On the bottom right of each card there is a glyph that is unique to each card design. The typography is reminiscent of Arabic or Farsi, but no direct connection has been made to any other language than English. Based on the [two poster designs](https://github.com/junk-shop/they-are-coming/wiki/posters) that have been found, two of the glyphs are seen to be translated to the letters D and J.

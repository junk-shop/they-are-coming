# The Case For Fortnite


### Initial Leaks

There is rumor of the next season of [Fortnite Season 7 being about aliens](https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2021/05/25/fortnite-leaks-reveal-an-imminent-alien-invasion-for-season-7/?sh=239ba35e1b5a). There is a URL associated with Iam8bit which uses the name of Fortnite's PvE mode (savetheworld.iam8bit.com), but that was debunked as part of an old event.

### Aussie Video

A Twitch Streamer by the name of [AussieAntics](https://www.twitch.tv/aussieantics) played a video on stream with a DVD and player, the whole video can be found [here](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1035370198), while the downloaded clip can be found in the repo [here](https://github.com/junk-shop/they-are-coming/blob/main/clues/aussie-clip-20210525.mp4).

  - [Initial Tweets](https://twitter.com/AussieAntics/status/1397365938576453633?s=20) - First tweets related to the DVD
  - [Confirmation Tweet](https://twitter.com/AussieAntics/status/1397366247168241664?s=20) - Secondary tweet affirming that it is most likely Fortnite-related due to another Fortnite Streamer, [Loserfruit](https://twitter.com/Loserfruit) also receiving a similar package

In the clip, the video from the DVD clearly shows the glyph from the [grid-hexagon](https://github.com/junk-shop/they-are-coming/wiki/grid-hexagon) card, in what looks to be a drawing of some sort on the ground in real life.

Later in the stream he is reported to have said that he would be making a video about it on 2021-05-26, but nothing more substantial came from it.

### Later Videos

As time went on, [more](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iw_Q0pZwdug) [streamers](https://youtu.be/pqEx__XVAdE?t=171) [started](https://twitter.com/InTheLittleWood/status/1397535179296624642) [receiving](https://youtu.be/c7PdIV65Ewc?t=164) similar DVDs. [Each of these DVDs held similar footage,](https://github.com/junk-shop/they-are-coming/wiki/Videos). Every one of these streamers are prominent in the Fortnite community.

### More Leaks

As the streamers released info about the DVDs they had received, more things were released about the upcoming Fortnite Chapter 2 Season 7. Most of this info relates to Aliens or UFOs:

## In-Game Connections

### Symbol

Throughout the game, there are multiple instances of a symbol similar to the symbol on the [6 orbs card](https://github.com/junk-shop/they-are-coming/wiki/six-orbs):

However, this symbol was also [found](https://github.com/junk-shop/they-are-coming/blob/main/clues/candlestick.jpg) in a [book of common symbols](https://github.com/junk-shop/they-are-coming/blob/main/clues/symbolbookfound.jpg) suggesting that the symbol is much more common that first believed.

### Loading Screen

In the first week of May, a small update came to Fortnite adding the new Fortnite Crew bonus. Among the update, there was a loading screen called "Bearallel Universe", pictured to the right. It was confirmed to be hinting towards the [June Fortnite Cew bonus, a skin called Mecha Cuddle Master](https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/news/mecha-cuddle-master-activates-in-fortnite-crew-for-june). The shows a futuristic city, with a sign that displays a planet with rings, a possibly allusion to [Saturn](https://github.com/junk-shop/they-are-coming/wiki/Saturn6-Theory).

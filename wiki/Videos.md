# Video AUS
There are 3 known Australian DVDs. The Australian video was the first one to appear of all of the videos with the first instance coming from streamer AussieAntics. There are currently 2 other known Australian videos that were revealed by LoserFruit and Muselk. All of the streamers are Fortnite streamers and all videos from Australia appear to be showing the same footage of hexagonal/cylindrical objects formatted in the shape of one of the symbols available on the cards. The videos were all low quality which has made pinpointing physical location difficult but the general theory at this time is that it's in Australia because that's where all of the recipients are from.

# Video GBR
There are 2 known UK DVDs. The UK video was the second one to appear of all of the videos and shows a full crop circle that seems to align with the compass and hexagon from the posters as well as showing each of the symbols from all 6 of the post cards (although 2 are distorted due to lines in the grass) and the presumed (but not confirmed) location of the video is in the UK. Both InTheLittleWood and Ali-A, the recipients, are Fortnite streamers.

# Video USA
There are 3 known US DVDs. The US video was the last one so far to be released (shortly after the UK videos). The video shows a desert landscape with some shiny metallic hexagons/hexagonal stars in the shape of one of the symbols from the postcards and as the video pans around, mountains can be seen in the background. The known recipients are SypherPK and Alixxa and both are Fortnite streamers. Alixxa's video wasn't found until 2 days after it was posted but is by far the clearest of any of the videos we have so far due to her using the video capture card instead of recording using her phone as most of the others did. We also don't have a confirmed location for this video, but the general area being targeted is the South Western part of the US.
On May 29th, a Brazilian streamer named Sharshock also received Video USA.

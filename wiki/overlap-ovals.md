## Design

The unique design for this postcard consists of two ovals overlapping each other, with no color in the area where they overlap. One oval is vertical, slimmer, and longer compared to the other oval, which is horizontal.

There us a circle off to the bottom right of the overlapped ovals.

At the top left there is a quarter section of the elongated asterisk symbol present on some of the other cards.

The 6 digit number written on this card is **310,478**.

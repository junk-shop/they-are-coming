## Design

The unique design for this postcard consists of six orbs aligned vertically in order of decreasing size, superimposed on a tilted oval with arcs that make it look like a globe.

To the right of the fourth and fifth globes from the top, there is the outline of a bracket that seems to group these two orbs together.

The 6 digit number written on this card is **267,502**.

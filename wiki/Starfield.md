# The Case For Starfield

### Our First Clues

Starfield is Bethesda's upcoming game, we know very little about it but there are a few reasons for the connection:
  - [Bethesda has worked with Iam8bit in the past](https://twitter.com/iam8bit/status/770269725821575168)
  - There's meant to be a showcase of Starfield at E3 this year.
  - Starfield is confirmed to be a sci-fi/space game.
  - [As mentioned before, most recipients had links to Iam8bit, Microsoft, and/or Bethesda](https://github.com/junk-shop/they-are-coming/wiki/Working-Threads#connections).

### Background

Typically, if Bethesda is showcasing a game at E3, they usually start teasing the presentation around the last week of May, or the first week of June. This is proven by both [Fallout 4](https://twitter.com/bethesdastudios/status/605744940006670337?lang=en) and [Fallout 76](

Starfield was strongly hinted at to be in Xbox and Bethesda's E3 presentation. [In the tweet announcing the E3 presentation,](https://twitter.com/Xbox/status/1397628683481882626) a planet can be seen in the bottom left of the image. In the [2018 Starfield Trailer](https://youtu.be/YFGZag0W_-o?t=29), a planet is shown that looks exactly the same as the planet in the E3 announcement.

### Further Connections 

Some of the reoccurring elements in the ARG also has ties to leaked content from Starfield. A reoccurring element of this ARG is [hexagons](https://github.com/junk-shop/they-are-coming/wiki/Saturn6-Theory#6). One of the major companies in Starfield is Called "Axion Energy". Pictured below, is a render of their logo, as well as it appearing in-game.

In addition, in an image of the player's UI, pictured to the left, there's two connections so imagery seen in the ARG. 
 
  - First, in the [forth audio call](https://github.com/junk-shop/they-are-coming/wiki/Phone-Call-Audio#fourth-audio-message) the spectrogram revealed some symbols that resemble the phases of the moon. The symbols are in the exact same style as one found in the UI.
  - Second, [one of the cards](https://github.com/junk-shop/they-are-coming/wiki/star-circles) has a two circles slightly overlapping, one much smaller than the other. This closely resembles the leaked ui, but not exactly.

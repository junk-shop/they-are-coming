# Debunks
As people are theorizing, it's easy to come to incorrect conclusions (we're all looking very hard!)

Here's a list of common clues people have brought up that have been debunked:

### Watermarked Barcodes (Postal Barcode)
Aside from the regular postal barcode written under the delivery address on the postcard, some users have reported additional similar barcodes printed in either invisible ink or watermarked.

This is common practice for some postal systems as an additional method of tracking, and do not offer additional info for this ARG.

### Coldplay ARG

Coldplay just finished a similar ARG with space symbolism for their new album.

Although the images are similar in style and shape, there was no Coldplay-related common link between people who received the postcards in the mail. From that alone, it should be safe to assume that this wasn't Coldplay's doing.

### Gravity Falls Vinyl

On Iam8bit's website, there is a listing for an unreleased [Gravity Falls Vinyl](https://www.iam8bit.com/products/gravity-falls-soundtrack-2xlp), where they "Occasionally, and with absolutely no warning, we’ll share glimpses of the album as it takes its final form, via the interwebs (ephemeral mail… err… e-mail; Twitter seances; etc.)". Gravity Falls is known to do ARGs like this for the past.

On May 25th, at about 9AM PST (Noon EST), someone discovered that Iam8bit had two subdomains registered, [dipperssecretshame](https://dipperssecretshame.iam8bit.com/) and [dipperssecretscheme](https://dipperssecretscheme.iam8bit.com/). The webpage displayed a text field work "Got the Password, Pine Tree?" written above it. Nothing happened for a while longer until around 6:30PM PST (10:30PM EST) the website was brought to attention again. After ~30 minutes of fiddling, the password "MasonPines" was used, which allowed access. What showed was an audio file of Dipper singing "Disco Girl", but nothing else. As of right now this is debunked as something related to They're Coming.

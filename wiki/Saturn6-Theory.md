# The Saturn6 Theory

### 6
For some reason, the number 6 frequently pops up. There are 6 postcards, 6 ordered pairs (or 6 six-digit numbers), 6 runes. When plotted on a grid, the ordered pairs form a 6-sided shape; a hexagon. One of the cards, [On one of the cards, there's a Hexagon and a 6x6 grid.](https://github.com/junk-shop/they-are-coming/wiki/grid-hexagon)

This leads to the thinking that there will be 4 more sets of posters; there are 2 currently: [D-Poster set](https://github.com/junk-shop/they-are-coming/wiki/d-posters) and [J-Poster set](https://github.com/junk-shop/they-are-coming/wiki/j-posters).

~~The audio calls have been confirmed to be updated twice; both times [they have six-word sentences](https://github.com/junk-shop/they-are-coming/wiki/phone-call-audio).~~
(Update: The fourth audio message, heard on May 27th, has a sentence longer than six words.)

### Saturn

Saturn seems to be involved somehow, as in the phone call the sounds appear to be [a recording of the sounds of Saturn](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sh2-P8hG5-E), or at least something eerily close to it.

In addition, Saturn is known to have [a hexagon on its northern polar cap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn%27s_hexagon), and is the 6th planet in our Solar System.

The circles on the posters have 12 arrows all uniformly spaced apart. One poster set has a J at the end of one arrow, and the other poster set has a D at the end of another arrow. 

When looking at the "[Traditional Numerical Designation](https://www.britannica.com/place/Saturn-planet/Moons)", the moon Janus has the designation 10, and the moon Dione designation 4. When looking at the circles like a clock, the letter "D" matches up with the number IV, and the letter "J" matches up with the number X.

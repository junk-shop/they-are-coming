# Phone Call Audio Messages

On the postcards and posters of "THEY'RE COMING", a phone number is found, depending on the location.  

United States: **+1 (575) 291-7617** _(Roswell, New Mexico)_  
United Kingdom: **+44 1722 638030** _(Salisbury, England)_  
Australia*: **+61 7 3186 1051** _(Brisbane, Queensland)_  
Germany**<sup>1</sup>: **+49 800 1816543** _(Toll-free number)_

Calling these numbers, pre-recorded audio messages can be heard. These audio messages change on a (mostly) daily basis. The audio messages are usually around 30 seconds long, and contain static sweeps (which conceal symbols that can be viewed in a spectrogram) and short voice-lines.

*The Australian phone number was only discovered on May 28th when images of posters in Australia were [shared on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/TheyreComing/comments/nmxm01/found_these_posters_in_sydney_61731861051/).  
**The German phone number was only discovered on May 28th when an image of a poster near the Frankfurter Tor was [shared on Twitter](https://twitter.com/EvilRoli/status/1398332011396407303).

<sup>1</sup>The audio messages heard when calling the German number match those of the other numbers, but the voice-lines are in German instead of English. Since the German number was only discovered on May 28th, we only have recordings of the German audio messages starting from the Fourth Audio Message. Whether or not the previous audio messages had a German version as well is unknown.

Garbled static sweeps and random noise. No intelligible speech.

    Heard when calling after:

    May 24th, 10PM BST - UK Number

A man's voice saying: "There's something weird going on" over different static sweeps.  
Spectrogram shows symbols that appear to be downward-pointing arrows.

Many have pointed out the similarities of the audio to the [Sounds of Saturn](https://github.com/junk-shop/they-are-coming/wiki/Working-Threads#saturn).

# Third Audio Message

    Heard when calling after:

    May 26th, 10PM BST - UK Number

A female voice saying: "Deciphering the signal is still ongoing", along with new static sweeps.  
Spectrogram revealed Gemini symbols, repeated three times.

Sidenote: It was thought at first that on May 25th the audio message was updated to make the speech more intelligible. Comparing spectrograms of all recordings shared online between May 24th and May 25th proved this to be false. No differences were found in the audio messages beyond the quality of the actual method used to record the phone call.

In the German audio message, the female voice says: "Wenn ihr euch mit seltsamen Signalen auskennt, meldet euch bei uns, okay?"

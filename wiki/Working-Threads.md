In the first few hours of the postcards being received, many people were wondering why they got the postcards. As people started getting together, a few things facts started coming together:

  - Most people who received a postcard ordered from the website [Iam8bit](www.iam8bit.com) at least once.
  - Most people are into video games / pop culture media.
  - Most people have accounts under stuff like: Microsoft, Nintendo, Sony, WB Games, Ubisoft, etc.

Things unexplained about this:

  - A very small amount of people who aren't gamers got this as well.
  - A smaller amount of people who haven't ordered from iam8bit got this as well.
  - People having less cards than others, some have 1 - some have 2 - some have 3 - barely anyone has 4 or more.

For now, the scope of this is mostly a mystery.

If you've received a card, there's a poll you can [fill out](https://forms.gle/r3XGp1qeggL16zV28).

## PAST THREADS

There are a few theories as to what this ARG is promoting, with attempts to work backwards from there:
### Halo
Halo Infinite is an upcoming Halo game that some are theorizing this could be for. Halo has a history of doing ARGs ([ILoveBees](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Love_Bees)). Halo is a Sci-Fi shooter that regularly features alien civilizations.
### Fortnite
There is rumor of the next season of [Fortnite Season 7 being about aliens](https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2021/05/25/fortnite-leaks-reveal-an-imminent-alien-invasion-for-season-7/?sh=239ba35e1b5a). There is a URL associated with Iam8bit which uses the name of Fortnite's PvE mode (savetheworld.iam8bit.com), but that was debunked as part of an old event.
### Iran
If the Ordered Pairs have decimal points added to them, they become coordinates over Iran. In the center of the Hexagon was a [Famous tree that held some sort of significance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarv-e_Abarkuh). 
### No Code
No Code is a Scottish game developer that has made two games in the past; [Stories Untold](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stories_Untold_(video_game)), and [Observation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observation_(video_game)). Observation is a game that centered on Hexagons, and more specifically, the Hexagon on Saturn's North Pole. This ARG is also something that Observation's publisher, Devolver Digital, would do. No Code has stated they're not working on a Observation sequel.
